## Code conventions

The coding conventions that I'm following in various programming languages.
Note that my coding conventions might reference other conventions or be
influenced by others. For each language I will add a section listing
alternative coding conventions. You can shamelessly copy these conventions,
reference them, etc.

Of course, this are my *personal* coding conventions, that I use in my personal
projects. You might disagree with them and that's completely fine. You can
suggest changes and, if they are consistent with my conventions (or fix an
inconstintency that I might have), I will accept them.
