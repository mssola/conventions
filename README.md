## Coding conventions

The coding conventions that I'm following in various programming languages.
Note that my coding conventions might reference other conventions or be
influenced by others. For each language I will add a section listing
alternative coding conventions or my influencers. You can shamelessly copy
these conventions, reference them, etc.

Of course, these are my *personal* coding conventions, that I use in my personal
projects. You might disagree with them and that's completely fine. When working
on an already existing codebase, I follow the *golden rule* described in the
[LLVM](http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html) coding conventions:

    If you are extending, enhancing, or bug fixing already implemented code, use
    the style that is already being used so that the source is uniform and easy
    to follow.

You can suggest changes and, if they are consistent with my conventions (or
fix an inconstintency that I might have), I will accept them.
