## Ruby

In Ruby there are two popular style guides:

1. [Github](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).
2. [Community-driven guide from
bbatsov](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

Personally, I'm all for the second option. The community-driven guide is
*extensive* and has all the good practices that any rubyist should follow. I
only have one objection: Perl-style global variables are accepted. I like Perl,
and even though I agree that Perl-style global variables are not very
descriptive, I'm used to them.
